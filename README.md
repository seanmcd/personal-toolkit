Personal Toolkit
================

This is a collection of scripts, snippets, and sundries that I've used to get
things done, both at my day job and in my personal projects. It's partially
here for my convenience, and partially here to demonstrate that I can locate my
own behind with both hands in various environments.

This collection of code is under the 3-clause BSD license. I care about
licenses and intellectual property, but trying to *enforce* them is a Sisyphean
tasks in the best of times, and certainly not worth it for this particular
collection. Hence the BSD license. It would bring me personal gratification to
hear that any of this code helped you get your own work done. :)
