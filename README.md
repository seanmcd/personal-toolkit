# Personal Toolkit #

## What this is ##

This is a collection of scripts, snippets, and sundries that I've used to get
things done, both at my day job and in my personal projects. It's partially
here for my convenience, and partially here to demonstrate that I can locate my
own behind with both hands in various environments.

## License ##

This collection of code is under the 3-clause BSD license. I care about
licenses and intellectual property rights, but trying to *enforce* them is a
Sisyphean task in the best of times, and certainly not worth it for this
particular collection. Hence the BSD license, which is permissive and simple.

It would bring me personal gratification to hear that any of this code helped
you get your own work done. :)
